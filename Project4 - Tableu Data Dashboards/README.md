# Build Data Dashboards: Flight Delays and Cancellations

## Project description
Create 3 visualizations to reveal insights from the Flight Delays and Cancellations data set. 


## About the data

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. 

The file used to create the data visualizations is the ''flights.csv'' file. 

The files ''airlines.csv'' and ''airports.csv'' are only used in conjustion with the main file to enhance the main data. 

Some questions include those pertaining to the following areas:

**Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?**

Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays? Doing this using maps is actually pretty difficult, but you may choose an alternative visual to provide this information. Think about what kind of aggregates might work best to determine which airlines and airports are the best and worst in terms of delays.

**What causes delays?**

Think about if you work at an airline and you want to decrease delays. What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?
